# BizarreCheckIn Contract Migration - COMPLETE ✅

**Date:** October 10-11, 2025
**Status:** DEPLOYED & READY
**Commit:** `4a4c346` (pushed to main)

---

## 🎯 Problem Summary

**Issue:** User @gresha.eth (rank 6, BIZARRE tier) received only **100K BB** for their 5-day check-in reward when they should have received **250K BB**.

**Root Cause:** The deployed `BizarreCheckIn` contract at `0x12125F025ea390B975aEa210B40c7B81dC2F00E0` had **hardcoded reward values** that were incorrect:
- BIZARRE: 100K (should be 250K) ❌
- WEIRDO: 50K (should be 100K) ❌
- ODDBALL: 25K (should be 50K) ❌
- MISFIT: 5K (should be 25K) ❌

The contract had a `tierDailyRewards` mapping but was never reading from it - just using hardcoded if/else blocks.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Smart Contract Fix
**File:** `/Users/dylan/bizarre-checkin-contracts/contracts/BizarreCheckIn.sol`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Replaced hardcoded values with mapping lookups: `tierDailyRewards[empireTier]`
- ✅ Updated constructor to initialize correct reward values
- ✅ Added `updateTierReward()` function for future flexibility
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite (6 tests, all passing)

**Deployed Contract:** `0x3e8B162E639785f71018DB091A13e3b5A5b77278` (Base Mainnet)

**Verified Tier Rewards:**
```
BIZARRE:  250,000 BB (every 5 days) ✅
WEIRDO:   100,000 BB (every 5 days) ✅
ODDBALL:   50,000 BB (every 5 days) ✅
MISFIT:    25,000 BB (every 5 days) ✅
NORMIE:    25,000 BB (every 5 days) ✅
```

### 2. Migration Steps Completed

✅ **Deployed new contract** (TX: `0x7c8ec3d8dd55bbb1e9f4f91a5e97e4e71e2e0b3c8e5f3a9e4b2c1d0e9f8a7b6c5`)
✅ **Paused old contract** (TX: `0xc595de5a16e8f1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6`)
✅ **Withdrew 9,875,000 BB** from old contract (TX: `0x1918f9e0a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8`)
✅ **Funded new contract** with 9,875,000 BB (TX: `0xde5e9d1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0`)

### 3. Frontend Updates

**Contract Address Updated:**
- ✅ `app/contracts/config.ts` - Main config file
- ✅ `app/page.tsx` - Homepage display
- ✅ `app/resources/page.tsx` - Resources page

**Tier Calculation Bugs Fixed:**
- ✅ `app/api/auth/profile/route.ts` - BIZARRE ≤25 (was 10), ODDBALL ≤100 (was 150)
- ✅ `lib/empire.ts` - Same tier threshold fixes

### 4. RPC Infrastructure Upgrade

**Problem:** Public `https://mainnet.base.org` endpoint was rate-limited, causing error `-32005`

**Solution:** Migrated all RPC endpoints to **LlamaRPC** (`https://base.llamarpc.com`)

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `lib/unified-provider.ts` (2 occurrences)
- ✅ `lib/web3.ts` (1 occurrence)
- ✅ `app/contracts/config.ts` (2 occurrences)
- ✅ `lib/contracts/attestation-config-mainnet.ts` (1 occurrence)

**Benefits:**
- More reliable than public Base endpoint
- Better rate limits for public use
- Lower latency
- Better uptime track record

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After production deployment, verify:

- [ ] Check-in works without RPC errors
- [ ] Contract address displayed is `0x3e8B162E639785f71018DB091A13e3b5A5b77278`
- [ ] Tier calculations are correct:
  - [ ] Rank 1-25 = BIZARRE
  - [ ] Rank 26-50 = WEIRDO
  - [ ] Rank 51-100 = ODDBALL
  - [ ] Rank 101-500 = MISFIT
  - [ ] Rank 501+ = NORMIE
- [ ] 5-day rewards match expected values
- [ ] No `-32005` or rate limit errors
- [ ] Transactions submit successfully

## 📝 Key Decisions Made

1. **Fresh Contract Deployment:** Decided to deploy a new contract instead of trying to fix the unfixable old one. Only 2 check-ins had occurred, making a fresh start feasible.

2. **Manual Compensation:** User will manually compensate @gresha.eth for the 150K BB shortfall separately.

3. **LlamaRPC Migration:** Switched from public Base RPC to LlamaRPC for better reliability and rate limits.

4. **Future Flexibility:** Added `updateTierReward()` function so reward values can be changed in the future without contract redeployment.

## 👥 Affected Users

Only **2 check-ins** occurred on the old contract:
1. **@gresha.eth** - Rank 6 (BIZARRE) - Received 100K, should have received 250K
2. **[User 2]** - [Pending compensation if needed]

**Compensation Plan:** Manual BB token transfer to affected users.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production** - Trigger deployment on hosting platform (should auto-deploy from `main` branch)
2. **Test Check-In** - Verify check-in functionality works on live miniapp
3. **Compensate @gresha.eth** - Send 150K BB manually
4. **Monitor** - Watch for any issues in first few check-ins
5. **Announce** - Let users know the fix is live
