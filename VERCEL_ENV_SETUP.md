## üîÑ Different Keys for Different Environments

### Development (.env.local)
- Use test/development keys
- Can be less secure (but still protect them!)
- Never commit to git

### Production (Vercel)
- Use production-specific keys
- Rotate regularly
- Use Vercel's encrypted environment variables for sensitive data

## ‚úÖ Setup Checklist

1. [ ] Log into Vercel Dashboard
2. [ ] Navigate to project settings
3. [ ] Add all NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables (safe for frontend)
4. [ ] Add sensitive variables as Encrypted type
5. [ ] Use different keys for production vs development
6. [ ] Test deployment with new variables
7. [ ] Verify no sensitive keys in git history
8. [ ] Set up rotation schedule for sensitive keys

## üöÄ Deployment Commands

After setting up environment variables:

```bash
# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# Or push to main branch if connected to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## üîê Security Best Practices

1. **Never use the same private keys in production and development**
2. **Rotate sensitive keys every 30-90 days**
3. **Use Vercel's encrypted environment variables for all sensitive data**
4. **Monitor access logs for unusual activity**
5. **Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts**

## üìä Variable Types in Vercel

- **Plaintext**: For non-sensitive data, visible in dashboard
- **Encrypted**: For sensitive data, hidden from dashboard view
- **Sensitive**: Alias for Encrypted, extra security measures

## üîë Key Rotation Schedule

Create a calendar reminder to rotate these keys:

- **Every 30 days**:
  - RITUAL_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY
  - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

- **Every 90 days**:
  - R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  - R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID

- **Every 6 months**:
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  - Review all other keys

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Environment variables not working?
1. Check variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Redeploy after adding/changing variables
3. Clear build cache if needed: Settings ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí Clear Cache

### Build failing?
1. Ensure all required variables are set
2. Check for typos in variable names
3. Verify values don't contain invalid characters

### Still using local keys in production?
1. IMMEDIATELY rotate compromised keys
2. Update Vercel environment variables
3. Redeploy application
4. Monitor for unauthorized access

## üìù Notes

- Vercel automatically injects these variables at build time
- NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix makes variables available to browser code
- Variables without NEXT_PUBLIC_ are server-side only
- Changes to environment variables require a new deployment

**Remember**: Your production environment should NEVER share keys with your local development environment!
